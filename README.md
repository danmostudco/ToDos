# Dan's Quick To Do List App
In learning any new framework, the famous go-to is a To-Do application. I decided to try my hand using Facebook's create-react installation, while also implementing some features like routing and database syncing.

### Installation
Just fork the repo and within the root folder run
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Easy peasy!

### What I learned
This was a good crash course in a number of topics. The big top line items were:
  - using create-react to spin up a simple react application
  - importing an outside css framework (in this case milligram)
  - refactoring already deployed code for great simplicity
  - rendering a list of components
  - adjusting content on the page dynamically through state
  - syncing state with firebase
  - basic routing using react-router 4
  - debugging package conflicts

### What's next
Now that I have puttered around with a basic CRUD application, I'm looking forward to slowly upping the complexity in future projects. I still have much to learn about more large scale routing and setting up other backend systems rather than firebase.
